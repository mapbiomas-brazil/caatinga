# Mapping methodology of Land Used Land Cover mapping of 35 years on project Mapbiomas/ Biome Caatinga

In this repository we share a set of scripts that were used for the construction of the use and coverage maps of the Caatinga biome in the 5.0 collection of the Mapbiomas project. The Maps were created from the Mapbiomas mosaics. Each mosaic corresponding to a year within the 1985-2019 series was trimmed by the limits of Hydrographic Basins of Brazil at level 2, figure 1. Some hydrographic basins were raised to level 3 in order to facilitate the Google Earth Engine api calculations.
